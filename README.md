# Memory Game


Memory Game is based on the board game Concentration.



## How to Play

At the beginning of the game all the cards will be face down, then you need to flip 2 cards and see the picture, automatically those cards will be again flipped and u will need to flip another par, the objective is to remember where is every picture to make pairs, when a pair is matched, those cards will stay face up, and the game will be over when all the cards are face up.



## Features

 - Correct and Wrong pair animation: If your cards flipped are pair they will have an animation to let u know that is correct and the same way if they are not correct.
